# Multiagent Coordination
* Background: An significant issue that arises in the automation of many surveillance tasks is that of monitoring the movements of targets(e.g. [Emily](http://emilyrobot.com/)) navigating in a bounded field of interest. 
* The project aimed to discover effective coordination between autonomous agents to perform foraging tasks with a UAV to constantly reposition.	
* The simulation is implemented on [MASON](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) which is a fast, easily extensible, discrete-event multiagent simulation toolkit in Java
* You can find results paper here.
